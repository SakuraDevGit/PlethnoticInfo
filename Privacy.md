# Plethnotic Privacy Policy

At *Plethnotic*, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. This Privacy Policy explains how *Plethnotic* (the “App”), a multiplication tables learning app, handles your information. Our goal is to keep things simple and transparent.

*Last updated: August 10, 2025*

## Data We Collect
*Plethnotic* is designed to keep your data local and private. Here’s what you need to know:

### Locally Stored Data
- **Profile Data**: When you create profiles in the App, details like profile names and settings are stored locally on your device.
- **Session Data**: Your multiplication practice session history, including scores and right/wrong answers, is saved locally on your device.
- **No Data Transmission**: None of this data (profiles or session history) is sent off your device or shared with us or any third parties.

### Crash Reports
- The App may collect anonymized crash reports to help us improve performance and fix bugs
- On iOS: Crash reports are collected through Apple’s crash reporting system and handled in accordance with their [privacy policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).
- On Android: Crash reports are collected through Google Play Console from devices where users have opted in to share usage and diagnostics data, as outlined in Google’s [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- These reports do not contain personally identifiable information and are used solely to identify technical issues.

### No Other Data Collection
- We do not collect personal information, such as your name, email, or location.
- We do not use cookies, trackers, or analytics tools in the App.
- The App works offline, so no internet connection is required, and no data is sent to servers.

## How We Use Your Data
- **Local Data**: Profile and session data are used solely within the App to provide a personalized learning experience, such as tracking your progress and customizing sessions.
- **Crash Reports**: Anonymized crash data may be used to identify and resolve technical issues, ensuring the App runs smoothly.

## Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or disclose any data from *Plethnotic* to third parties, except for anonymized crash reports sent to Apple as noted above. Your profile and session data remain on your device and are not accessible to us or anyone else.

## Data Security
Since all profile and session data is stored locally on your device, its security depends on your device’s protections (e.g., passcode or biometric locks). We recommend keeping your device secure to protect your data.

## Data Retention and Deletion
- **Local Data**: Profile and session data remain on your device until you delete the App or manually remove profiles within the App.
- **Uninstalling the App**: If you uninstall *Plethnotic*, all locally stored data (profiles and session history) is automatically deleted from your device.
- **No Server Data**: Since we don’t store data on servers, there’s no additional data for us to retain or delete.

## Children’s Privacy
*Plethnotic* is designed to be safe for kids. We do not collect personal information from children or anyone else, and all data stays on the device. Parents and guardians can feel confident that the App complies with applicable children’s privacy laws, such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted on this page with a new “Last updated” date. Please check back periodically for changes.
